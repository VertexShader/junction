Junction - Windows 8 Interface for administration, management and data manipulation of Riak Clusters.

Features:
---
This is the shortlist of what the project is aiming for:

 * **Call the Doctor! (Administration & Maintenance)**
This part of the application would provide an interface for all the general administration and maintenance needs around individual nodes and around the overall cluster of nodes. The ability to add, remove and generally administer everything that is available via the riak-admin command line interface.

 * **Love of the Data (Reporting)**
This division of the application would be focused on reporting. I'm not sure what exactly that would entail, but something with charts, graphs and pulling together trending points of some sort. If you have ideas and want to work on this part of the application, weigh in!

 * **Golfing With Your Data (Query, Put, Deletes, Etc. Handling the CRUD)**
 The application will have an interface to provide access to add and remove data, as well as viewing the data that is available within a cluster. The primary means for implementing this part of the application will be with the CorrugatedIron Project. It's a library available via Nuget that @peschkaj and @OJ have put together.

 * **Time Travel That Data (Performance Benchmarking)**
This section of the application will provide the ability to benchmark the timing of data in and out of a cluster. In addition it should show standard benchmarking similar to that which is offered with the basho_bench project.

 * **News! News! News! (News...  RSS Feed Reader)**
The idea is that this will provide a quick and easy way to get familiar with Windows 8 dev and the project overall. I'm aiming to eat the Basho blog feed and provide it as key highlights for the application with future abilities around mining other RSS feeds or such and having those fed into a ??  Riak Cluster? Again, everything is open to change, addition or removal! So jump into the project and let me know your thoughts.
